Fore some months [our group](http://info.baudisgroup.org) has worked with members
of Kurt Stockinger's team from the ZHAW on a cancer cell lines use case for the 
[INODE](https://www.inode-project.eu/inode) project. In the last 2 days we had a
site visit for a first implementation of the use case specific system on 
[cancercelllines.org](http://cancercelllines.org). More information to follow - and
thanks to Ellery & Dimitris for the great work!
